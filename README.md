# Lunar-Landing
2d Game created with Unity

This game is a recreation of the popular Lunar Lander game. 

Lunar Lander is a single-player arcade game in the Lunar Lander subgenre. It was developed by Atari, Inc. and released in August 1979. In the game, the player controls a lunar landing module as viewed from the side and attempts to land safely on the Moon.

In my version, the player is given a set amout of fuel and must control the ship and land on one of the colored platforms. If the player touches anything other than the platform the game is over.

The game can be played at https://elangeni.itch.io/lunar-landing.

The controls are as follows:
